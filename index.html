        <p><b>Khaled Walid Khaled Sourani</b> <img src = "images/kh.jpeg"> Student in the islamic University of gaza
            2 semesters away from finishing my bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering
            in hoping of becoming a web Developer after Graduation
            Currently Iam self studying some Web and aiming to become a backend in Laravel-PHP i still don't know
            if that is really what i want to become in the future but its going to be a starting point
            in my self studying so far i have finished HTML AND CSS and currently Studying Java script
            and iam using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> and <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">free code camp</a>
            as my resources
            My plan is going to be <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Front END</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish Html</li>
            <li>Finish CSS</li>
            <li>Finish Java script basics</li>
            <li>learn about DOM and BOM and understanding them</li>
            <li>Getting into Jquery and AJAX</li>
            <li>Learn bootstrap</li>
            <li>Learn about JSON</li>
            <li>learn some basics about SASS and a front end framework</li>
        </ul>
        <i>NOTE: Iam aiming to be a back End Developer but i want to get the front END basics down
            The reason iam not interested in front END is because iam not fond of designing i hate picking between 2
            colors
        </i>
        <br>
        <i>But iam learning all those Front end basics just incase i had to do some Frontend works Because i really
            don't know what
            what the future is holding for me
        </i>
        <h3>BACK END</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>learn PHP</li>
            <li>Learn some software Engineering(already rereading the book prof.Hatem taught us in the software
                Engineering course)</li>
            <li>and other stuff</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ofc i still need to learn other skills like GIT and some Data Structures and algorithms those are very
            important</p>
        <p>Here is one Small project i worked on for FreeCodeCamp its a bit scuffed and very basic but its what i can do
            with HTML
            and CSS i mean html is easy enough but CSS is a bit tough with the flexboxes and grids
        </p>
